\chapter{Colophon}
\thispagestyle{empty}

\noindent\newthought{This book} was typeset with \LaTeX\xspace. The design is based on the Tufte-\LaTeX{} book class available at \url{https://github.com/Tufte-LaTeX/tufte-latex}. The main font is Palatino. In addition Helvetica and Bera Mono are used. I use the \texttt{lilyglyps} package for musical symbols and the \texttt{xpiano} package for keyboard illustrations. The diagrams was made using Apple's Keynote and the music was engraved with Sibelius 7.5.
