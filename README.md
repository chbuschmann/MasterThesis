# The Musical Conventions of Star Trek
## Abstract
The music of science fiction. Why did it become to sound the way it does and how does the musical mechanisms work? How are space, the extraordinary, the fantastic and the outer-worldly depicted in western science fiction filmography? This thesis takes a historical and analytical perspective as it looks closer on the musical constructions we find in the music of the movies of _Star Trek_. Using conventional music analytical tools combined with neo-Riemannian Theory and transformational theory this thesis hopes to shed light on the inner workings in the music of _Jerry Goldsmith_, _James Horner_ and _Michael Giacchino_ in the iconic films: "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", "Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan", "Star Trek: First Contact", "Star Trek: Nemesis", "Star Trek" and "Star Trek: Into Darkness".
